#Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
#Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
#Compare the length of your first name and your last name
#Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
#Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
#Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
#The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
#Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
#Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
#Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
